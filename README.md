# Pet-Projects
This repo contains my pet projects. You might see a decent web interface (Streamlit) of each project (hopefully ðŸ¤ž).

**For beginners:**

To clone (download) my github repositories, open the terminal, and type:

`git clone "https://github.com/BansalAryamanBansal/Pet-Projects".git`

This will download all the pet projects on your computer. To download specific ones, navigate to their respective folders, copy the url, and paste it inside double quotes. 

For example, to download the Digit Recognizer project, open the terminal and type:

`git clone "https://github.com/BansalAryamanBansal/Pet-Projects/tree/main/Digit%20Recognizer".git`

And voila! The project will be downloaded on your computer.

Note: I'm using Linux Ubuntu, so this might not work for Windows.
