# Pet-Projects
This repo contains my pet projects. You might see a decent web interface (Streamlit) of each project (hopefully ðŸ¤ž).

**For beginners:**

To clone (download) all my pet projects, open the terminal, and type:

`git clone "https://github.com/BansalAryamanBansal/Pet-Projects".git`

This will download all my pet projects on your computer.

Note: I'm using Linux Ubuntu, so this might not work on Windows.
